# First C# Code: Hello World! 🌍

Hello World! 👋

Today I take my first step in **C#** and start this wonderful journey with the classic “Hello World.” 🚀
This small step will be the harbinger of big projects in the future. I will continue with many more beautiful coding.

Here’s the code I wrote:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World! My coding journey begins here 🚀");
    }
}

Thanks to everyone who’s supporting me on this journey! 💻 Stay tuned for more updates.

Follow along with my progress on this exciting adventure!
